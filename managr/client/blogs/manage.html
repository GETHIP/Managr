According to all known laws
of aviation,


there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.


Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.


The bee, of course, flies anyway


because bees dont care
what humans think is impossible.


Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.


Ooh, black and yellow!
Lets shake it up a little.


Barry! Breakfast is ready!


Ooming!


Hang on a second.


Hello?


- Barry?
- Adam?


- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I cant. Ill pick you up.


Looking sharp.


Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.


Sorry. Im excited.


Heres the graduate.
Were very proud of you, son.


A perfect report card, all Bs.


Very proud.


Ma! I got a thing going here.


- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! Thats me!


- Wave to us! Well be in row 118,000.
- Bye!


Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!


- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.


- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.


Never thought Id make it.


Three days grade school,
three days high school.


Those were awkward.


Three days college. Im glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.


You did come back different.


- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.


- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.


- You going to the funeral?
- No, Im not going.


Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.


Dont waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.


I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.


I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.


Thats why we dont need vacations.


Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.


- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!


- Bee-men.
- Amen!


Hallelujah!


Students, faculty, distinguished bees,


please welcome Dean Buzzwell.


Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...


...9:15.


That concludes our ceremonies.


And begins your career
at Honex Industries!


Will we pick ourjob today?


I heard its just orientation.


Heads up! Here we go.


Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.


- Wonder what itll be like?
- A little scary.


Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco


and a part of the Hexagon Group.


This is it!


Wow.


Wow.


We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life


to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.


Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.


Our top-secret formula


is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured


into this soothing sweet syrup


with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...


Honey!


- That girl was hot.
- Shes my cousin!


- She is?
- Yes, were all cousins.


- Right. Youre right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive


to improve every aspect
of bee existence.


These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.


- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.


Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.


- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey


that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.


Oan anyone work on the Krelman?


Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know


that every small job,
if its done well, means a lot.


But choose carefully


because youll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.


The same job the rest of your life?
I didnt know that.


Whats the difference?


Youll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, havent had one day off


in 27 million years.


So youll just work us to death?


Well sure try.


Wow! That blew my mind!


Whats the difference?
How can you say that?


One job forever?
Thats an insane choice to have to make.


Im relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.


But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?


Why would you question anything?
Were bees.


Were the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.


You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?


Like what? Give me one example.


I dont know. But you know
what Im talking about.


Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.


Wait a second. Oheck it out.


- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.


Ive never seen them this close.


They know what its like
outside the hive.


Yeah, but some dont come back.


- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!


You guys did great!


Youre monsters!
Youre sky freaks! I love it! I love it!


- I wonder where they were.
- I dont know.


Their days not planned.


Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.


You cantjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.


Right.


Look. Thats more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.


Its just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.


Perhaps. Unless youre wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.


Those ladies?
Arent they our cousins too?


Distant. Distant.


Look at these two.


- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Lets have fun with them.


It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.


Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!


He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!


- Oh, my!
- I never thought Id knock him out.


What were you doing during this?


Trying to alert the authorities.


I can autograph that.


A little gusty out there today,
wasnt it, comrades?


Yeah. Gusty.


Were hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.


- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!


A puddle jump for us,
but maybe youre not up for it.


- Maybe I am.
- You are not!


Were going 0900 at J-Gate.


What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?


I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.


Hey, Honex!


Dad, you surprised me.


You decide what youre interested in?


- Well, theres a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.


Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?


Son, let me tell you about stirring.


You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.


You get yourself into a rhythm.
Its a beautiful thing.


You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,


maybe the honey field
just isnt right for me.


You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?


Thats a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.


Janet, your sons not sure
he wants to go into honey!


- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- Im not trying to be funny.


Youre not funny! Youre going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!


- Youre gonna be a stirrer?
- No ones listening to me!


Wait till you see the sticks I have.


I could say anything right now.
Im gonna get an ant tattoo!


Lets open some honey and celebrate!


Maybe Ill pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.


Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody dawg


Im so proud.


- Were starting work today!
- Todays the day.


Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.


Yeah, right.


Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...


- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!


One of thems yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.


- Whatd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!


Wow!


Oouple of newbies?


Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!


Make your choice.


- You want to go first?
- No, you go.


Oh, my. Whats available?


Restroom attendants open,
not for the reason you think.


- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, youre on.


Im sorry, the Krelman just closed out.


Wax monkeys always open.


The Krelman opened up again.


What happened?


A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
Hes dead. Another dead one.


Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.


Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. Thats life!


Oh, this is so hard!


Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,


humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,


mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?


Barry!


All right, weve got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...


What happened to you?
Where are you?


- Im going out.
- Out? Out where?


- Out there.
- Oh, no!


I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.


Youre gonna die! Youre crazy! Hello?


Another call coming in.


If anyones feeling brave,
theres a Korean deli on 83


that gets their roses today.


Hey, guys.


- Look at that.
- Isnt that the kid we saw yesterday?


Hold it, son, flight decks restricted.


Its OK, Lou. Were gonna take him up.


Really? Feeling lucky, are you?


Sign here, here. Just initial that.


- Thank you.
- OK.


You got a rain advisory today,


and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.


So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,


hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.


Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.


Murphys in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!


- Thats awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,


bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!


All right, launch positions!


Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!


Black and yellow!


Hello!


You ready for this, hot shot?


Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.


Wind, check.


- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.


- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.


Scared out of my shorts, check.


OK, ladies,


lets move it out!


Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!


All of you, drain those flowers!


Wow! Im out!


I cant believe Im out!


So blue.


I feel so fast and free!


Box kite!


Wow!


Flowers!


This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.


Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.


Roses!


30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.


Stand to the side, kid.
Its got a bit of a kick.


That is one nectar collector!


- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.


I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,


a pinch on that one.
See that? Its a little bit of magic.


Thats amazing. Why do we do that?


Thats pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.


Cool. Im picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Dont we …</p>
